# Storage Block

This mod not register 'block of ingot'

Each mods can has same block of ingot
  
That blocks may have different properties

Can't decide one value each properties

That's reason

# Processing Tree

Depending on the final item of the ore, it is divided into 3 processing trees

## Dust

* Ore
* Dirty Slurry
* Clean Slurry
* Shard
* Clump
* Dirty Dust
* Dust

Ingot not exist ores's processing is finish to dust

e.g.) Project Red's Electrotine

## Ingot

* Extends from 'Dust'
* Dust smelting into Ingot
* Ingot can split to nuggets

## Gem

* Extends from 'Dust'
* Dust enriching into Gem
