# MoreMekanismProcessing

Add mekanism's ore processing to other mod's ores<br>
It can 1 ore process into up to 5 ingots<br>
That is so fantastic<br>

<b>Require [Mekanism](https://github.com/mekanism/mekanism)</b>

# Storage Block

<b>This mod not register 'block of ingot'</b>

Each mods can has same block of ingot<br>
That blocks may have different properties<br>

Can't decide 1 value every properties<br>
That's reason

# Processing Tree

Depending on the final item of the ore, it is divided into 2 processing trees

## Ingot

1. Ore
2. Dirty Slurry
3. Clean Slurry
4. Shard
